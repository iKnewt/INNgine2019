## About this game engine project
A game engine originally created as a school project in a course on game engine architecture (fall 2019), and later revisited for further development.

[Doxygen Documentation found here](https://codedocs.xyz/iKnewt/INNgine2019/)

The engine is made in QT, using the Build Kit: Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit
Uses openGL for graphics and openAL for audio. Libs needed to run project, working on an executable, will include video later.

### Alberto Engine
My team's delivery for the school project, the team consisting of @martinGFA and myself.
We tried to create an Entity Component System as best we could. We pretty much cooperated on all parts of the engine, my main domains were rendering and managers (of entities, components and assets).

This is the final commit we had on the engine during the course:

(We originally wanted to create a voxel engine to generate something like Minecraft, but ended up dropping as time went on and we had to add features to the project that were not needed for such an engine)

This is what the engine looked like then:

To view our pre-made scene you can load the GameScene.json file, or you can create a scene from scratch and save it using the editor. 

### The Original INNgine2019
The original repository for this project is private within a group created for the class, which is why I am cloning the repository from there, so I can further develop the project.

The initial commit is the base project as handed out in class, included for comparison. This is what it looked like:
