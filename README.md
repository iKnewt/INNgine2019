## About this game engine project
A game engine originally created as a school project in a course on game engine architecture (fall 2019), and later revisited for further development.

### Alberto Engine
My team's delivery for the school project, the team consisting of @martinGFA and myself.
We tried to create an Entity Component System as best we could. We pretty much cooperated on all parts of the engine, my main domains were rendering and managers (of entities, components and assets).

This is the final commit we had on the engine during the course:

(We originally wanted to create a voxel engine to generate something like Minecraft, but ended up dropping as time went on and we had to add features to the project that were not needed for such an engine)

This is what the engine looked like then:

### The Original INNgine2019
The original repository for this project is private within a group created for the class, which is why I am cloning the repository from there, so I can further develop the project.

The initial commit is the base project as handed out in class, included for comparison. This is what it looked like:
